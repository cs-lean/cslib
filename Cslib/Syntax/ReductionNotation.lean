  This command adds notations for a relation, its reflexive transitive closure, and its
  equivalence closure. This should not usually be called directly, but as an attribute. 

  As an example `reduce_notation foo "β"` will add the notations "⇢β", "↠β", and "≈β".

  Note that the string used will afterwards be registered as a notation. This
  means that if you have also used this as a constructor name, you will be
  quotes to access corresponding cases, e.g. «β» in the above example.

  declaration, such as in:

  ```
  @[reduce_notation "ₙ"]
  def PredReduction (a b : ℕ) : Prop := a = b + 1
